  - There have been several Riser groups that have entered Gloomwood before.
  - Then a portal took them to a higher floor.
  - But they left and never came back.
  - And after a while the boss will be revived.
  - We noticed that the tower would weaken if the boss of that floor was destroyed.
  - Therefore we believe that there is a greater force behind these floor bosses.
  - And if we can defeat it, maybe we can end the tower.
