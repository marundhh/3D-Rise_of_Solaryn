  - Welcome, and greetings to the Rise Guild.
  - You must be a new Riser, correct? I have already received word about your arrival.
  - "As per tradition, you are required to undertake a trial before being granted
    an official Riser certification.  \r\n"
  - 'Only then will you be permitted to begin your ascent of the Tower.

'
